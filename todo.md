# Jalmar Quest Roadmap Checklist

## Milestone 1: Core Foundation & Backend
- [x] Establish KMP project structure with shared core modules (`core:model`, `core:state`, `core:di`), platform launchers (`app:android`, `app:desktop`), Koin dependency injection, Gradle 8.14 build pipelines with version catalog, and multi-module project structure
- [x] Provision backend data stores (`players`, `lore_snippets`) with JSONB columns, run migrations, define Kotlin serialization models, and seed baseline snippets (implemented via `backend:database` with `JsonGuestAuthGateway` for desktop session persistence)
- [x] Implement Event Engine v0 (`feature:eventengine`) with deterministic snippet resolution, cooldown rules, status-effect gates, choice logging via `GameStateManager.appendChoice()`, consequence application through inventory/status mutations, and comprehensive unit tests
- [x] Draft AI Director system prompt, validate Gemini request/response schemas, implement rate limiting, create sandbox fixtures, and establish server hooks (`backend:aidirector` with `GeminiAiDirectorClient`, `SandboxAiDirectorClient`, `RateLimitingAiDirectorClient`, environment-based configuration via `AiDirectorConfig.fromEnvironment()`, and deployment bootstrap via `AiDirectorDeployment`)
- [x] Build UI shell with Compose Multiplatform bottom navigation (`JalmarQuestApp.kt`), section routing (Explore/Hub/Nest/Systemic/Activities), platform-specific launchers with crash reporting initialization, and touch-optimized Material3 theming
- [x] Integrate localization framework (Moko Resources with EN/NO string resources), TTS expect/actual bridges (`SpeechSynthesizer` with Android TextToSpeech and Desktop implementation), guest authentication flows (`InMemoryGuestAuthGateway`, `JsonGuestAuthGateway`), analytics logging via `GameStateManager.appendChoice()`, defensive error handling with `CrashReporter`, and auth token storage (`AuthTokenStorage` expect/actual pattern)

## Milestone 2: Core Gameplay Loops (Vertical Slice)
- [x] Implement Nest critter management system (`feature:nest`) with `NestStateMachine` handling recruitment via `acceptRecruitment()`, role assignment via `assignRole()`/`unassign()`, passive Seed accumulation timers, and upgrade request scaffolding via `requestUpgrade()`, integrated with `GameStateManager` for choice analytics
- [x] Deliver Explore narrative loop UI (`ExploreSection.kt`) with `ExploreController` managing branching choice presentation, `ExplorePhase` state machine (NARRATIVE → CHOOSING → RESOLVING), status effect updates, inventory reward delivery, and TTS narration using `SpeechSynthesizer.speak()` with auto-generated section announcements
- [x] Ship Systemic Interactions v1 (`feature:systemic`) with item/status requirement resolver, contextual interaction options based on player state, failure/success messaging delivery, and edge-case unit tests covering requirement validation
- [x] Flesh out Buttonburgh hub locations (`HubModels.kt` with `defaultHubLocations()`): Pack Rat's Hoard (shop action), Quailsmith (craft + systemic actions), Quill's Study (chronicle + activities + explore actions), Hen Pen (nest action), plus `HubStateMachine` navigation flows with `selectLocation()` and `triggerAction()` choice logging
- [x] Prototype secondary activities system (`feature:activities`) with four activity types (dungeon, arena, nest defense, apex predator teaser) defined in `ActivityModels.kt`, linked to choice tag propagation via `ActivitiesStateMachine.startActivity()`, and stubbed reward hooks for future integration
