**Purpose**: Wire all Phase 1-3 systems into dependency injection for proper lifecycle management

**Additions**:
- **Phase 1 Catalogs** (3): NpcCatalog, EnemyCatalog, LocationCatalog
- **Phase 2 NPC & World Systems** (5): InGameTimeManager, NpcScheduleManager, NpcRelationshipManager, FactionManager, DialogueManager
- **Phase 3 Advanced AI & Ecosystem** (6): NpcAiGoalManager, NpcReactionManager, DynamicDialogueManager, PredatorPatrolManager, ResourceRespawnManager, FactionTerritoryManager
- **Phase 4 Polish & Balance** (4): RegionDifficultyManager, PlayerLocationTracker, WeatherSystem, SeasonalCycleManager

**Integration Points**:
- 18 new singleton definitions with proper dependency chains
- 18 new resolver functions for type-safe dependency access
- All managers use `::currentTimeProvider` for consistent time tracking

**Key Dependencies**:
```kotlin
// Phase 3 managers depend on Phase 1-2 systems
NpcAiGoalManager(npcCatalog, scheduleManager, relationshipManager, timeManager, gameStateManager)
DynamicDialogueManager(baseDialogueManager, npcCatalog, relationshipManager, reactionManager, questManager, factionManager, timeManager, gameStateManager)
```

### 2. RegionDifficultyManager (336 lines)
**Purpose**: Dynamic difficulty scaling across 5 difficulty tiers and 55+ locations

**Difficulty Tiers**:
1. **SAFE (Tier 1)**: Buttonburgh - Tutorial zone
   - 1.0x enemy stats
   - 1.5x resource spawns (+50% more resources)
   - 0.7x respawn time (30% faster)
   - Recommended level: 5

2. **EASY (Tier 2)**: Forest, Beach - Beginner exploration
   - 1.2x enemy stats
   - 1.5x XP/Seeds rewards
   - 1.2x resource spawns
   - Recommended level: 10

3. **MEDIUM (Tier 3)**: Swamp - Intermediate challenge
   - 1.5x enemy stats
   - 2.0x XP/Seeds rewards
   - Normal resource spawns
   - Recommended level: 15

4. **HARD (Tier 4)**: Mountains, Ruins - Advanced content
   - 2.0x enemy stats
   - 3.0x XP/Seeds rewards
   - 0.8x resource spawns (20% fewer)
   - 1.3x respawn time (30% slower)
   - Recommended level: 20

5. **EXTREME (Tier 5)**: Boss encounters
   - 3.0x enemy health, 2.5x damage
   - 5.0x XP/Seeds rewards
   - 0.5x resource spawns (50% fewer)
   - 2.0x respawn time (2x slower)
   - Recommended level: 25

**Scaling Functions**:
- `scaleEnemyHealth/Damage/Xp()`: Apply multipliers to enemy stats
- `scaleResourceSpawnChance/RespawnTime()`: Adjust resource availability
- `scaleQuestXp/Seeds()`: Reward progression balance
- `getLootQualityBonus()`: 0.0-1.0 bonus for higher tiers
- `meetsRecommendedLevel()`: Player level gate checking

**Location Assignments**: 55+ locations registered across all regions with appropriate difficulty tiers

**Design Philosophy**:
- Risk vs Reward: Higher difficulty = better rewards but scarcer resources
- Progressive Difficulty: Clear player progression path from SAFE → EXTREME
- Recommended levels prevent early access to hard content
- Balanced economy prevents resource farming exploits

### 3. PlayerLocationTracker (214 lines)
**Purpose**: Track player movement and enable location-based game mechanics

**Core Features**:
- **Current Location Tracking**: Real-time location with arrival timestamps
- **Visit History**: Comprehensive visit analytics per location
  - Visit count
  - Last visit timestamp
  - Duration spent at location
- **Recent Locations**: Last 10 locations visited (for quest tracking)
- **Region Detection**: Auto-extract region from location ID

**Integration Points**:
1. **PredatorPatrolManager**: Trigger aggro when player enters territories
2. **ResourceRespawnManager**: Enable harvesting at current location
3. **FactionTerritoryManager**: Check territory access permissions
4. **QuestManager**: Track "visit location" objectives
5. **NpcAiGoalManager**: NPCs react to player location (SEEK_PLAYER goals)

**Key Methods**:
- `moveToLocation(locationId)`: Update player position
- `getCurrentLocationId()`: Get current location
- `hasVisited(locationId)`: Check if location discovered
- `getVisitCount(locationId)`: Track exploration depth
- `isInRegion(regionId)`: Region membership check
- `getRegionExplorationCount()`: Track exploration progress

**Serializable State**:
```kotlin
PlayerLocationState(
    currentLocation: PlayerLocation?,
    visitHistory: Map<String, LocationVisit>,
    recentLocations: List<String>
)
```

**Analytics Support**:
- Total locations visited
- Most visited location
- Time spent per location/region
- Recent movement patterns for dialogue context

### 4. WeatherSystem (155 lines)
**Purpose**: Dynamic weather simulation with 6 weather conditions

**Weather Conditions**:
1. **CLEAR** (40% chance): 1-3 severity, 3-6 hour duration
2. **RAINY** (20% chance): 2-6 severity, 1-3 hour duration
3. **HOT** (10% chance): 3-7 severity, 4-8 hour duration
4. **COLD** (10% chance): 3-7 severity, 3-7 hour duration
5. **FOGGY** (10% chance): 4-8 severity, 1.5-4 hour duration
6. **STORMY** (10% chance): 6-10 severity, 30min-1.5 hour duration

**Weather Severity Scale (1-10)**:
- 1-3: Mild (light drizzle, gentle breeze)
- 4-6: Moderate (steady rain, thick fog)
- 7-10: Severe (heavy downpour, violent storm)

**Features**:
- **Auto-progression**: `updateWeather()` checks duration and transitions
- **Manual control**: `setWeather()` for quest/event triggers
- **Weighted random**: Natural weather distribution (40% clear, rare storms)
- **Context for dialogue**: DynamicDialogueManager uses weather for context
- **Atmospheric descriptions**: `getWeatherDescription()` for UI display

**Integration**:
- **DynamicDialogueManager**: Weather-aware dialogue
  - "Lovely weather we're having" (CLEAR)
  - "Best stay inside during this storm" (STORMY)
- **Future**: Weather affects resource spawns, NPC schedules, combat

---

### 5. SeasonalCycleManager (141 lines)
**Purpose**: Seasonal progression aligned with ResourceRespawnManager

**Seasonal System**:
- **4 Seasons**: SPRING → SUMMER → AUTUMN → WINTER
- **90 game days per season** (360-day year)
- **1 real hour = 1 game day** (fast progression for engagement)
- **Season phases**: Early (days 0-29), Mid (30-59), Late (60-89)

**Season Characteristics** (from ResourceRespawnManager):
1. **SPRING**: High growth phase (2.0x respawn speed modifier)
2. **SUMMER**: Normal growing season (1.0x baseline)
3. **AUTUMN**: Harvest season (1.5x respawn speed)
4. **WINTER**: Scarce resources (0.7x respawn speed)

**Features**:
- **Auto-progression**: `updateSeason()` tracks real-time and advances seasons
- **Manual control**: `setSeason()` for testing/events
- **Progress tracking**: Days into season, days remaining
- **Descriptive UI**: "Early Spring (15% through season)"

**Integration**:
- **ResourceRespawnManager**: Seasonal modifiers affect all respawn times
  - Spring mushrooms respawn 2x faster
  - Winter resources 30% slower
- **Future**: Seasonal quests, NPC dialogue, exclusive resources

## Balancing Decisions

### Difficulty Curve Philosophy
**Progression Arc**: Tutorial → Exploration → Challenge → Mastery → Extreme

| Tier | Recommended Level | Content Type | Risk/Reward |
|------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| SAFE | 1-5 | Tutorial, town | Low risk, low reward |
| EASY | 5-10 | Early exploration | Balanced |
| MEDIUM | 10-15 | Mid-game | Moderate risk, good rewards |
| HARD | 15-20 | End-game | High risk, great rewards |
| EXTREME | 20-25 | Boss encounters | Extreme risk, legendary rewards |

**Design Goals**:
1. Clear progression path prevents frustration
2. Recommended levels gate content naturally
3. Risk vs Reward balances economy (harder areas = better loot but scarcer resources)
4. Loot quality bonus (0.0-1.0) encourages high-tier exploration

### Resource Economy Balance

**Resource Spawn Philosophy**: Abundance → Scarcity as difficulty increases

| Region | Spawn Multiplier | Respawn Multiplier | Rationale |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Buttonburgh | 1.5x | 0.7x (faster) | Beginner-friendly, abundant |
| Forest/Beach | 1.2x | 0.9x | Slight abundance |
| Swamp | 1.0x | 1.0x | Baseline |
| Mountains/Ruins | 0.8x | 1.3x (slower) | Scarcity increases challenge |
| Boss Areas | 0.5x | 2.0x (slowest) | Extreme scarcity |

**Economy Validation Metrics**:
- **Safe zones**: 50% more resources than hard zones (prevents farming exploits)
- **Respawn times**: 30% faster in safe zones (encourages progression)
- **Seasonal variation**: 0.7x-2.0x range prevents resource droughts/floods

**Balance Goals**:
1. Prevent low-level farming exploits (hard zones have better rewards, not resources)
2. Encourage natural progression (resources abundant early, scarce late)
3. Seasonal variety adds strategic planning (harvest in Spring/Autumn)

### Quest Reward Scaling

**XP/Seeds Multipliers by Tier**:
- SAFE: 1.0x baseline
- EASY: 1.5x
- MEDIUM: 2.0x
- HARD: 3.0x
- EXTREME: 5.0x

**Design Rationale**:
- Exponential scaling prevents level gaps
- High-tier quests feel rewarding
- Players naturally progress through tiers as they level

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Location-Based Mechanics
```kotlin
// Player enters new location
playerLocationTracker.moveToLocation("forest_spider_den")

// Check difficulty
val difficulty = regionDifficultyManager.getDifficultyTier("forest_spider_den")
if (!regionDifficultyManager.meetsRecommendedLevel(playerLevel, "forest_spider_den")) {
    // Show warning
}

// Check territory rules
if (!factionTerritoryManager.canAccessTerritory("forest_spider_den", player)) {
    // Deny entry or trigger combat
}

// Trigger predator aggro
if (predatorPatrolManager.getEnemiesAtLocation("forest_spider_den").isNotEmpty()) {
    predatorPatrolManager.notifyPlayerEntered("forest_spider_den")
    // Start combat
}

// Check resources
val resources = resourceRespawnManager.getAvailableResourcesAtLocation("forest_spider_den")
// Enable harvesting UI
```

### Pattern 2: Context-Aware Dialogue
```kotlin
// Build dialogue context
val context = dynamicDialogueManager.buildContext(npcId, playerId, playerLocationTracker, weatherSystem, seasonalCycleManager)

// Context includes:
// - Current location
// - Weather condition
// - Season
// - Time of day
// - Relationship level
// - Recent events
// - Quest progress

val greeting = dynamicDialogueManager.getDynamicGreeting(npcId, context)
```

### Pattern 3: Seasonal Resource Management
```kotlin
// Update seasonal cycle
seasonalCycleManager.updateSeason()

// Get current season
val season = seasonalCycleManager.getCurrentSeason()

// Resource manager auto-applies seasonal modifiers
resourceRespawnManager.setSeason(season)

// Spring: 2.0x faster respawns
// Summer: 1.0x baseline
// Autumn: 1.5x faster respawns
// Winter: 0.7x slower respawns
```

### Pattern 4: Difficulty-Scaled Combat
```kotlin
// Spawn enemy in region
val baseEnemy = enemyCatalog.getEnemy("forest_spider")
val regionId = playerLocationTracker.getCurrentRegion()

// Apply difficulty scaling
val scaledHealth = regionDifficultyManager.scaleEnemyHealth(baseEnemy.health, regionId)
val scaledDamage = regionDifficultyManager.scaleEnemyDamage(baseEnemy.damage, regionId)
val scaledXp = regionDifficultyManager.scaleEnemyXp(baseEnemy.xpReward, regionId)

// Forest spider in Mountains:
// - 2.0x health
// - 2.0x damage
// - 3.0x XP reward
```

## Performance Considerations

### Update Loop Optimization

**Managers requiring periodic updates**:
1. **PredatorPatrolManager**: Update every 5-10 minutes (patrol movement)
2. **ResourceRespawnManager**: Update every 1 minute (respawn checks)
3. **WeatherSystem**: Update every 5 minutes (weather transitions)
4. **SeasonalCycleManager**: Update every 1 hour (season progression)
5. **NpcAiGoalManager**: Update every 1-5 minutes (goal evaluation)

**Optimization Strategies**:
- **Lazy evaluation**: Only check expired timers, not all state
- **Batch updates**: Group updates by frequency (1min, 5min, 1hr buckets)
- **Caching**: Cache difficulty scaling results (rarely changes)
- **StateFlow**: Reactive updates prevent polling

**Example Optimized Update Loop**:
```kotlin
// In GameController or similar
fun updateWorldSystems() {
    val now = timestampProvider()
    
    // Every 1 minute
    if (now - lastMinuteUpdate >= 60_000) {
        resourceRespawnManager.updateResourceSpawns()
        lastMinuteUpdate = now
    }
    
    // Every 5 minutes
    if (now - last5MinUpdate >= 300_000) {
        predatorPatrolManager.updatePredatorPositions()
        weatherSystem.updateWeather()
        npcAiGoalManager.updateAi()
        last5MinUpdate = now
    }
    
    // Every 1 hour
    if (now - lastHourUpdate >= 3_600_000) {
        seasonalCycleManager.updateSeason()
        lastHourUpdate = now
    }
}
```

**Target Performance**: 60fps maintained with all systems active

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **PlayerLocationTracker**: Location state not yet integrated into Player model serialization (separate state management)
2. **WeatherSystem**: Weather doesn't affect gameplay mechanics yet (dialogue-only)
3. **SeasonalCycleManager**: Seasonal progression is time-based, not player-controlled
4. **RegionDifficultyManager**: Difficulty tiers are static (no dynamic adjustment)

### Phase 2 KMP Compatibility Issues
**Not related to Phase 4 code**, but Phase 2 managers have JVM-specific API calls:
- `Map.getOrDefault()` → Use `map[key] ?: default` instead
- `Map.replaceAll()` → Use manual iteration
- `Math.min()` → Use `kotlin.math.min()` or `coerceAtMost()`
- `System.currentTimeMillis()` → Use injected `timestampProvider`

**Impact**: commonMain compilation fails, but Android target compiles successfully

**Fix Priority**: Low (Android is primary target), can be addressed when adding iOS support

### Phase 5 Priorities
1. **UI Integration**: Wire Phase 4 managers into UI layer
   - Location display with difficulty warning
   - Weather/season indicators
   - Resource availability UI
   - Territory access warnings

2. **Quest Flow Integration**: Connect Phase 3 quest systems
   - NpcAiGoalManager OFFER_QUEST goals
   - Quest completion → NpcReactionManager events
   - QuestTriggerManager → location triggers

3. **Full KMP Support**: Fix Phase 2 compatibility issues for iOS builds

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Weather affects gameplay (visibility, resource spawns, NPC behavior)
   - Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on player performance
   - Seasonal events and exclusive content
   - Territory conquest mechanics
