# Phase 2: NPC Dynamic Behavior Systems - Complete

## Overview
Phase 2 builds upon the expanded world from Phase 1 by adding sophisticated NPC behavior systems. NPCs now have daily schedules, relationship tracking, branching dialogues, and connections to the quest and lore systems.

## Implementation Date
January 26, 2025

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- All managers are Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) compatible
- Located in `core/state` module for shared business logic
- Use Kotlin coroutines and `StateFlow` for reactive updates
- `@Serializable` data classes for persistence support

### Integration Points
- **InGameTimeManager**: Provides time progression for NPC schedules
- **QuestManager**: Quest trigger system interfaces with existing quest catalog
- **LoreManager**: Lore distribution unlocks lore via existing manager
- **LocationCatalog**: All systems reference Phase 1 expanded locations
- **NpcCatalog**: NPC-based systems reference Phase 1 expanded NPCs

### Dependencies
- `kotlinx-serialization`: Data persistence
- `kotlinx-coroutines`: Async operations
- `kotlinx-datetime`: Time management

## Content Statistics

### Phase 2 Additions
- **5 new manager systems** (NPC Schedule, Relationship, Dialogue, Quest Trigger, Lore Distribution)
- **10 NPCs with daily schedules** (5 time slots each = 50 total schedule entries)
- **10 NPCs with gift preferences** (7 categories, 5 reaction types)
- **50+ quest triggers** across all 6 regions
- **30+ lore objects** with diverse discovery methods
- **6 requirement types** for gating content
- **8 consequence types** for dialogue outcomes
- **8 discovery methods** for lore exploration

### Code Metrics
- **~1,650 lines of new code** across 5 manager files
- **0 compilation errors** (verified with Gradle build)
- **Thread-safe operations** using Mutex where needed
- **Comprehensive query APIs** for all systems

## Testing Status
- ✅ Compilation verified (Gradle build successful)
- ⏳ Unit tests pending (integration testing required)
- ⏳ DI wiring pending (CoreModule registration needed)
- ⏳ Integration with GameStateManager pending

## Next Steps (Post-Phase 2)
1. **DI Integration**: Register all managers in `CoreModule`
2. **UI Hookup**: Connect managers to feature modules (explore, hub, activities)
3. **Unit Tests**: Create comprehensive test suites for each manager
4. **Integration Tests**: Verify cross-manager interactions (dialogue → quest triggers, schedules → relationships)
5. **Balancing**: Adjust affinity gains, quest requirements, lore difficulty
6. **Content Expansion**: Add more schedules, dialogues, triggers, lore as needed

## Conclusion
Phase 2 transforms NPCs from static catalog entries into dynamic, interactive inhabitants of the world. The combination of schedules, relationships, branching dialogues, quest triggers, and lore distribution creates a living, breathing game world where player choices and exploration are rewarded with deepening narrative complexity.

The systems are designed to work together:
- NPCs move through the world on schedules
- Players build relationships through gifts and conversations
- High-affinity dialogues unlock new quests and lore
- Exploration triggers quest discoveries
- Lore objects reward curiosity and world engagement

This foundation enables rich emergent gameplay where the world feels reactive to player actions.
