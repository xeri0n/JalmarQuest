# Phase 3: Advanced NPC AI and Ecosystem Simulation - Complete

## Overview
Phase 3 implements advanced NPC AI systems and dynamic ecosystem simulation, bringing the game world to life with intelligent NPCs, dynamic events, context-aware dialogue, predator patrols, resource regeneration, and faction territorial control.

## ✅ Completed Systems (6 major systems, ~2,400 lines of code)

### 1. NPC AI Goal System (`ai/NpcAiGoalManager.kt` - 430 lines)

**Purpose**: Give NPCs autonomous behaviors with priority-based goals that adapt to time, relationships, and world context.

**Key Features**:
- **17 Goal Types**: SEEK_FOOD, SEEK_REST, SEEK_SHELTER, SOCIALIZE, SEEK_PLAYER, AVOID_PLAYER, VISIT_FRIEND, WORK_PROFESSION, GATHER_RESOURCES, CRAFT_ITEMS, EXPLORE_AREA, INVESTIGATE_EVENT, OFFER_QUEST, REQUEST_HELP, FLEE_DANGER, DEFEND_TERRITORY, SEEK_SAFETY
- **5 Priority Levels**: CRITICAL (100), HIGH (75), MEDIUM (50), LOW (25), MINIMAL (10)
- **Dynamic Priority Calculation**: Goals adjust priority based on time of day, NPC needs, and relationship with player
- **Goal Conditions**: String-based conditions (ReachLocation, TimeOfDayReached, PlayerAffinityAbove, AlwaysSucceeds)
- **Goal Expiration**: Time-limited goals with automatic cleanup
- **Stuck Detection**: Tracks NPCs that can't complete goals for 5+ minutes
- **Daily Routine Integration**: Automatically assigns goals based on NPC schedules

**Example Usage**:
```kotlin
// Assign a goal for an NPC to seek player when friendly
aiManager.assignGoal(
    npcId = "clara_seedsworth",
    type = GoalType.SEEK_PLAYER,
    basePriority = GoalPriorityFactor.MEDIUM,
    conditionType = "PlayerAffinityAbove",
    metadata = mapOf("affinityThreshold" to "60"),
    description = "Looking for you to offer a special deal"
)
```

**Statistics**:
- 17 goal types for diverse NPC behaviors
- 5 priority factors with context-based modifiers
- Time-based priority adjustments (+20 for REST at night, +15 for WORK during day)
- Relationship-based priority adjustments (+10 affinity/10 for SEEK_PLAYER)

---

### 2. NPC Reaction System (`ai/NpcReactionManager.kt` - 395 lines)

**Purpose**: NPCs dynamically react to world events, player choices, faction changes, and quest outcomes.

**Key Features**:
- **15 World Event Types**: PLAYER_CHOICE, PLAYER_QUEST_COMPLETE, PLAYER_QUEST_FAILED, PLAYER_KILLED_ENEMY, PLAYER_DIED, FACTION_REP_INCREASED/DECREASED, FACTION_STANDING_CHANGED, FACTION_WAR_STARTED, FACTION_ALLIANCE_FORMED, LOCATION_DISCOVERED/CHANGED, NPC_DIED, NPC_JOINED_PLAYER, RARE_ITEM_ACQUIRED, SEASON_CHANGED, DAY_PASSED, FESTIVAL_STARTED, CUSTOM
- **17 Reaction Types**: HAPPY, SAD, ANGRY, FEARFUL, GRATEFUL, DISAPPOINTED, BECOME_FRIENDLY, BECOME_HOSTILE, OFFER_REWARD, REFUSE_SERVICE, FLEE_LOCATION, SEEK_PLAYER, SPECIAL_DIALOGUE, GOSSIP, WARNING, OFFER_NEW_QUEST, FAIL_QUEST, UNLOCK_LOCATION, NEUTRAL
- **Reaction Rules**: Predefined NPC reactions to specific events with optional conditions
- **Affinity Changes**: Reactions can modify NPC-player relationships
- **Timed Reactions**: Reactions expire after a set duration
- **Event History**: Tracks all world events with timestamps
- **Triggered State**: Prevents reactions from repeating when shown to player

**Example Events**:
```kotlin
// Record player completing a quest
reactionManager.recordEvent(
    type = WorldEventType.PLAYER_QUEST_COMPLETE,
    questId = "quest_giga_seed",
    sourceNpcId = "professor_tessel"
)

// Record player gaining faction reputation
reactionManager.recordEvent(
    type = WorldEventType.FACTION_REP_INCREASED,
    factionId = "faction_buttonburgh",
    metadata = mapOf("amount" to "25")
)
```

**Default Reaction Rules** (4 registered):
1. Elder Quill grateful when Buttonburgh reputation reaches 50 (+5 affinity)
2. Sergeant Talon happy when player kills enemies (+3 affinity)
3. Herbalist Sage fearful when player dies (offers healing herb, 60-minute reaction)
4. Clara Seedsworth offers discount when Buttonburgh reputation reaches 75 (24-hour bonus)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Manager Pattern**: Each system has a dedicated manager class
- **StateFlow Integration**: All state changes exposed as Kotlin Flow for reactive UI
- **Kotlinx Serialization**: All data classes marked @Serializable for save/load
- **Mutex Thread Safety**: NpcRelationshipManager uses mutex for concurrent access
- **Timestamp Provider**: Injected dependency for testability
- **Nullable Integration**: Systems work with optional quest/relationship managers

### Dependencies
```
NpcAiGoalManager ← NpcCatalog, NpcScheduleManager, NpcRelationshipManager, InGameTimeManager, GameStateManager
NpcReactionManager ← NpcCatalog, NpcRelationshipManager, FactionManager, QuestManager, GameStateManager
DynamicDialogueManager ← DialogueManager, NpcCatalog, NpcRelationshipManager, NpcReactionManager, QuestManager, FactionManager, InGameTimeManager, GameStateManager
PredatorPatrolManager ← EnemyCatalog, InGameTimeManager
ResourceRespawnManager ← LocationCatalog, InGameTimeManager
FactionTerritoryManager ← LocationCatalog, FactionManager, InGameTimeManager
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **String-Based Conditions**: Simplified serialization by using string-based condition types instead of sealed classes (Phase 3 trade-off for build success)
2. **Simplified Quest Integration**: Quest manager methods assumed but not fully wired (getQuestState, getActiveQuests, getCompletedQuests) - deferred for Quest system implementation
3. **Nullable Metadata**: NpcRelationship.metadata field accessed safely (doesn't exist yet, simplified for Phase 3)
4. **Faction ID Prefixes**: Switched from "buttonburgh" to "faction_buttonburgh" for consistency with FactionManager defaults
5. **Biome Field Deferred**: Location.biome field not yet added - resource spawn biome modifiers commented out for now

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Deferred for Phase 4)

### Partial Implementations
1. **Goal Conditions**: Only 3 of 8 condition types fully implemented (ReachLocation, PlayerAffinityAbove, AlwaysSucceeds)
   - Missing: WaitDuration, NearPlayer, HasItem, TimeOfDayReached, InteractWithNpc
2. **Reaction Conditions**: Simplified to string-based, full condition checking deferred
3. **Dialogue Context Requirements**: Simplified checking, not all 12 requirement types validated
4. **Player Location Tracking**: Several features await player location system (NearPlayer goal, PlayerAtLocation reaction/dialogue)
5. **NPC Inventory**: HasItem goal condition awaits NPC inventory system
6. **Quest Integration**: Full quest API integration pending (getQuestState, getActiveQuests, getCompletedQuests)

### Missing Features (Phase 4 Candidates)
1. **Advanced Pathfinding**: NPCs teleport to scheduled locations, no actual movement
2. **Goal Interruption**: NPCs can't be interrupted mid-goal by higher-priority events
3. **Complex Dispute Mechanics**: Territory disputes don't affect world state during conflict
4. **Weather System**: Weather conditions defined but not dynamically changing
5. **Seasonal Progression**: Season changes must be manually triggered
6. **Resource Depletion**: No concept of resource scarcity or permanent depletion
7. **Faction Alliance/War**: Event types defined but no faction conflict simulation
8. **NPC Memory**: NPCs don't remember past interactions beyond relationship tracking

```kotlin
// In core/di module
single { NpcAiGoalManager(get(), get(), get(), get(), get(), { System.currentTimeMillis() }) }
single { NpcReactionManager(get(), get(), get(), get(), get(), { System.currentTimeMillis() }) }
single { DynamicDialogueManager(get(), get(), get(), get(), get(), get(), get(), get(), { System.currentTimeMillis() }) }
single { PredatorPatrolManager(get(), get(), { System.currentTimeMillis() }) }
single { ResourceRespawnManager(get(), get(), { System.currentTimeMillis() }) }
single { FactionTerritoryManager(get(), get(), get(), { System.currentTimeMillis() }) }
```

### UI Integration Points
