# Alpha 2.2 Phase 5C: Donation Rewards System - Complete

**Date**: Current Session  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented and verified  
**Build**: Successful (core:state, core:di modules verified)

## Overview
Phase 5C implements the reward delivery system for the $2.99 Creator Coffee donation feature. When players purchase coffee to support development, they immediately receive valuable in-game rewards as a thank-you.

## Reward Summary

| Reward | Type | Value | Auto-Granted |
|--------|------|-------|--------------|
| **Golden Coffee Bean** | Shiny Collectible | 5,000 Seeds | ✅ Yes |
| **Patron's Crown** | Cosmetic (Crown) | Legendary Tier | ✅ Yes |
| **Exhausted Coder Affinity** | NPC Relationship | +50 points | ✅ Yes |
| **Post-Coffee Dialogue** | Narrative Content | ~700 lines | ✅ Unlocked |

## Implementation Details

### 1. Golden Coffee Bean Shiny (Pre-Existing)
**File**: `core/state/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/jalmarquest/core/state/hoard/ShinyValuationService.kt` (line 143)

```kotlin
ShinyDefinition(
    id = ShinyId("golden_coffee_bean"),
    nameKey = "shiny_golden_coffee_bean_name",
    descriptionKey = "shiny_golden_coffee_bean_desc",
    rarity = ShinyRarity.LEGENDARY,
    baseValue = 5000,
    category = ShinyCategory.FOOD,
    tags = setOf("rare", "quest_reward", "creator_gift")
)
```

**Status**: Already existed from previous work with full test coverage.

### 2. Patron's Crown Cosmetic (New)
**File**: `core/state/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/jalmarquest/core/state/shop/ShopCatalog.kt` (line 136)

```kotlin
ShopItem(
    id = ShopItemId("cosmetic_crown_patron"),
    name = "Patron's Crown",
    description = "Exclusive golden crown awarded to supporters of JalmarQuest development. " +
                  "A mark of honor for those who fuel the creator's coffee addiction. " +
                  "Not available for purchase - granted only to those who buy the creator a coffee.",
    glimmerCost = 0, // Not purchasable with Glimmer
    category = ShopCategory.COSMETICS,
    rotationFrequency = RotationFrequency.PERMANENT,
    cosmeticType = CosmeticType.CROWN,
    stock = 1, // One-time grant
    rarityTier = 5 // Legendary tier
)
```

**Key Features**:
- Exclusive cosmetic (cannot be purchased with Glimmer)
- Legendary rarity tier (5/5)
- One-time grant only
- Permanent (won't rotate out of inventory)

### 3. Reward Delivery Method (Enhanced)
**File**: `core/state/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/jalmarquest/core/state/GameStateManager.kt` (lines 227-268)

```kotlin
suspend fun grantCreatorCoffeeRewards(
    hoardManager: HoardRankManager?,
    npcRelationshipManager: NpcRelationshipManager? = null
): Boolean {
    // Check eligibility
    if (!player.playerSettings.hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee || 
        player.playerSettings.hasReceivedCoffeeRewards) {
        return false
    }
    
    // Grant all rewards
    hoardManager?.acquireShiny(ShinyId("golden_coffee_bean"))
    updateShopState { it.addPurchase(ShopItemId("cosmetic_crown_patron")) }
    npcRelationshipManager?.addAffinity("npc_exhausted_coder", 50)
    
    // Mark as claimed
    updatePlayerSettings { it.copy(hasReceivedCoffeeRewards = true) }
    appendChoice("coffee_rewards_granted")
    
    return true
}
```

**Changes This Session**:
- ✅ Added Patron's Crown cosmetic grant
- ✅ Updated KDoc to document all 3 rewards
- ✅ Updated performance logging

### 4. Automatic Trigger (New)
**File**: `core/state/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/jalmarquest/core/state/monetization/GlimmerWalletManager.kt`

**Constructor Update** (lines 16-23):
```kotlin
class GlimmerWalletManager(
    private val gameStateManager: GameStateManager,
    private val timestampProvider: () -> Long,
    private val entitlementManager: EntitlementManager? = null,
    private val hoardManager: HoardRankManager? = null,
    private val npcRelationshipManager: NpcRelationshipManager? = null
)
```

**Purchase Flow Integration** (lines 48-74):
```kotlin
if (product.id.value == "creator_coffee_donation") {
    // Set purchase flag
    gameStateManager.updatePlayerSettings { settings ->
        settings.copy(hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee = true)
    }
    
    // Unlock dialogue
    gameStateManager.appendChoice("creator_coffee_purchased")
    gameStateManager.appendChoice("coffee_donation_completed")
    
    // Grant rewards immediately
    if (hoardManager != null) {
        gameStateManager.grantCreatorCoffeeRewards(
            hoardManager = hoardManager,
            npcRelationshipManager = npcRelationshipManager
        )
    }
    
    return PurchaseResult.Success(amountAdded = 0, newBalance = player.glimmerWallet.balance)
}
```

**Key Implementation**:
- Rewards granted **immediately** upon IAP completion
- No manual claim required
- Idempotent via `hasReceivedCoffeeRewards` flag

### 5. Dependency Injection Update
**File**: `core/di/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/jalmarquest/core/di/CoreModule.kt` (line 188)

```kotlin
single { GlimmerWalletManager(
    gameStateManager = get(), 
    timestampProvider = ::currentTimeProvider, 
    entitlementManager = get(),
    hoardManager = get(),
    npcRelationshipManager = get()
) }
```

## State Flow Architecture

```
Player Purchases Coffee ($2.99)
    ↓
IIapService.launchPurchaseFlow()
    ↓
GlimmerWalletManager.purchaseGlimmer()
    ↓
├─ Set hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee = true
├─ Log "creator_coffee_purchased"
├─ Log "coffee_donation_completed"
└─ GameStateManager.grantCreatorCoffeeRewards()
       ├─ Grant Golden Coffee Bean shiny
       ├─ Grant Patron's Crown cosmetic
       ├─ Add +50 affinity with Exhausted Coder
       ├─ Set hasReceivedCoffeeRewards = true
       └─ Log "coffee_rewards_granted"
    ↓
Return PurchaseResult.Success
```

## Choice Tag Integration

| Tag | Purpose | When Logged |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `creator_coffee_purchased` | Analytics | IAP completion |
| `coffee_donation_completed` | Unlock dialogue | IAP completion |
| `coffee_rewards_granted` | Confirm delivery | Reward grant |
| `rewards_acknowledged` | Player viewed dialogue | NPC interaction |

## Testing Status

### Build Verification
- ✅ `core:state` module builds successfully
- ✅ `core:di` module builds successfully
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Dependency injection resolves correctly

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Golden Coffee Bean: Full coverage in `ShinyValuationServiceTest.kt`
- ✅ `grantCreatorCoffeeRewards()`: Has test coverage for shiny/affinity
- ⏳ Cosmetic grant: Can add in Phase 7

### Manual Testing
- ⏳ End-to-end IAP flow (requires platform setup)
- ⏳ Cosmetic appearance in inventory
- ⏳ Shiny appearance in Hoard Collection

## Remaining Work

### Optional Enhancements (Low Priority)
1. **UI Feedback**: Update `CoffeeDonationSection.kt` to show "Rewards Claimed" state
2. **Additional Tests**: Add unit tests specifically for cosmetic granting

### Integration Required
- **Phase 6 (Localization)**: Add NO translations for:
  - `shiny_golden_coffee_bean_name`
  - `shiny_golden_coffee_bean_desc`
  - Patron's Crown strings
- **Phase 7 (Testing)**: Manual QA for full donation flow

## Files Modified

| File | Module | Changes | Type |
|------|--------|---------|------|
| `GameStateManager.kt` | core:state | ~10 lines | Enhancement |
| `GlimmerWalletManager.kt` | core:state | ~20 lines | Enhancement |
| `ShopCatalog.kt` | core:state | +14 lines | Addition |
| `CoreModule.kt` | core:di | ~5 lines | Enhancement |

**Total**: ~50 lines of code

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture
- ✅ Separation of concerns (reward logic vs trigger logic)
- ✅ Idempotency via flag checks
- ✅ Optional dependencies for graceful degradation
- ✅ Thread-safe mutations via GameStateManager
- ✅ Complete audit trail via PerformanceLogger

### Data Integrity
- ✅ One-time purchase enforced
- ✅ One-time rewards enforced
- ✅ Choice tags for analytics
- ✅ Serializable state preservation

### User Experience
- ✅ Instant reward delivery
- ✅ No manual claim required
