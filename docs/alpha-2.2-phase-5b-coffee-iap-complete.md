# Alpha 2.2 Phase 5B: Coffee IAP Implementation - Complete

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Build Status**: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 11s  
**Implementation Time**: ~20 minutes

---

## Overview

Phase 5B implements the "A Cup of Creator's Coffee" IAP product, a $2.99 donation mechanism that allows players to support the developer. Upon purchase, the system sets a permanent flag that triggers special rewards in Phase 5C (Golden Coffee Bean shiny, special Exhausted Coder dialogue).

## Deliverables

### 1. Creator Coffee IAP Product

**File**: `core/model/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/jalmarquest/core/model/GlimmerShards.kt`

**Product Definition**:
```kotlin
val CREATOR_COFFEE = IapProduct(
    id = ProductId("creator_coffee_donation"),
    name = "A Cup of Creator's Coffee",
    description = "Support the developer with a coffee! Unlocks special thank-you rewards from the Exhausted Coder.",
    glimmerAmount = 0, // Pure donation, no currency
    priceUsd = 2.99,
    metadata = mapOf(
        "is_donation" to "true",
        "unlocks_exhausted_coder_rewards" to "true",
        "one_time_purchase" to "true"
    )
)
```

**Key Properties**:
- **ID**: `creator_coffee_donation`
- **Price**: $2.99 USD
- **Type**: One-time purchase (non-repeatable)
- **Glimmer Amount**: 0 (pure donation, no in-game currency)
- **Metadata**: Tagged as donation with reward unlock flag

**Catalog Integration**:
- Added to `IapProductCatalog.getAllProducts()` list
- Now 12 total IAP products (6 Glimmer packs + 4 character slots + 1 battle pass + 1 coffee)

### 2. Purchase Flow Implementation

**File**: `core/state/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/jalmarquest/core/state/monetization/GlimmerWalletManager.kt`

**Purchase Logic**:
```kotlin
// Alpha 2.2: Creator Coffee donation
if (product.id.value == "creator_coffee_donation") {
    // Check if already purchased (one-time only)
    if (player.playerSettings.hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee) {
        return PurchaseResult.InvalidProduct("Creator Coffee already purchased")
    }
    
    // Set flag in player settings
    gameStateManager.updatePlayerSettings { settings ->
        settings.copy(hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee = true)
    }
    
    // Log analytics
    gameStateManager.appendChoice("creator_coffee_purchased")
    
    return PurchaseResult.Success(
        amountAdded = 0,
        newBalance = player.glimmerWallet.balance
    )
}
```

**Flow Diagram**:
```
Player clicks "Buy Coffee" → IapService.launchPurchaseFlow(CREATOR_COFFEE)
    ↓
Platform billing (Google Play/Desktop stub)
    ↓
PurchaseResponse.Success with receipt + transactionId
    ↓
GlimmerWalletManager.purchaseGlimmer()
    ↓
Check if already purchased (prevent duplicates)
    ↓
Set hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee = true in PlayerSettings
    ↓
Log "creator_coffee_purchased" choice tag
    ↓
Return PurchaseResult.Success (0 Glimmer added)
```

### 3. Platform Integration

#### Desktop (Stub Implementation)
**File**: `core/state/src/desktopMain/kotlin/com/jalmarquest/core/state/monetization/IapService.kt`

**Status**: ✅ Already functional (no changes needed)
- Automatically populates all products from `IapProductCatalog.getAllProducts()`
- Creator Coffee now included in simulated product list
- Purchase flow: Simulates $2.99 payment, generates desktop receipt/token
- Always succeeds for testing purposes

**Console Output Example**:
```
[IapService:Desktop] Initialized with 12 simulated products
[IapService:Desktop] Simulated purchase: A Cup of Creator's Coffee for $2.99
```

#### Android (Scaffold Ready)
**File**: `core/state/src/androidMain/kotlin/com/jalmarquest/core/state/monetization/IapService.kt`

**Status**: ⚠️ Scaffold exists, Google Play Billing integration deferred
- Product ID: `creator_coffee_donation`
- Type: One-time product (INAPP, non-consumable)
- Requires: `acknowledgePurchase()` within 3 days (Android requirement)

**Integration Steps (Deferred to Polish Phase)**:
1. Add Google Play Billing Library dependency
2. Configure product in Google Play Console
3. Implement `BillingClient` initialization
4. Wire `launchPurchaseFlow()` to `BillingFlowParams`
5. Handle `PurchasesUpdatedListener` callback
6. Acknowledge purchase via `acknowledgePurchase()`
7. Test with sandbox accounts

### 4. Player Settings Flag

**File**: `core/model/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/jalmarquest/core/model/Player.kt`

**Field**: Already exists from previous implementation
```kotlin
@Serializable
data class PlayerSettings(
    /**
     * Tracks if player has purchased "A Cup of Creator's Coffee" donation item.
     * Used to trigger permanent NPC_EXHAUSTED_CODER dialogue changes.
     */
    @SerialName("has_purchased_creator_coffee")
    val hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee: Boolean = false
)
```

**Access Pattern**:
```kotlin
val player = gameStateManager.playerState.value
if (player.playerSettings.hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee) {
    // Unlock special Exhausted Coder dialogue (Phase 5C)
    // Grant Golden Coffee Bean shiny (Phase 5C)
    // Add "Patron" cosmetic (Phase 5C)
}
```

### 5. Analytics & Tracking

**Choice Tag**: `creator_coffee_purchased`

**Purpose**:
- Analytics tracking for donation conversions
- Event triggers for Phase 5C rewards
- Historical purchase record in ChoiceLog

**Integration Points**:
- **GlimmerWalletManager**: Logs tag on successful purchase
- **ChoiceLog**: Permanent record with timestamp
- **AI Director**: Can detect supporter status for adaptive content

## Technical Implementation

### One-Time Purchase Enforcement

**Method**: Product ID check + player flag
```kotlin
// Prevent duplicate purchases
if (player.playerSettings.hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee) {
    return PurchaseResult.InvalidProduct("Creator Coffee already purchased")
}
```

**Why not consume?**:
- Creator Coffee is non-consumable (one-time support)
- Consume is only for repeatable purchases (Glimmer packs)
- Platform stores (Google Play/App Store) enforce non-consumable rules

### State Synchronization

**Update Flow**:
```kotlin
gameStateManager.updatePlayerSettings { settings ->
    settings.copy(hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee = true)
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Atomic update via GameStateManager
- Reactive StateFlow propagation
- Autosave triggers (when implemented)
- Cross-platform state sync ready

### Error Handling

**Scenarios Handled**:
1. **Already Purchased**: Returns `PurchaseResult.InvalidProduct`
2. **Payment Cancelled**: Platform returns `PurchaseResponse.Cancelled`
3. **Network Error**: Platform returns `PurchaseResponse.NetworkError`
4. **Duplicate Receipt**: Caught by existing duplicate detection logic

## Phase 5C Integration Hooks

### Reward Triggers (Phase 5C Implementation)

1. **Golden Coffee Bean Shiny**:
```kotlin
if (player.playerSettings.hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee) {
    hoardManager.acquireShiny(ShinyId("golden_coffee_bean"))
}
```

2. **Exhausted Coder Dialogue**:
```kotlin
val dialogueType = if (player.playerSettings.hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee) {
    DialogueType.COFFEE_GRATITUDE
} else {
    DialogueType.GREETING
}
```

3. **Relationship Bonus**:
```kotlin
if (player.playerSettings.hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee) {
    npcRelationshipManager.addAffinity("npc_exhausted_coder", 50)
}
```

4. **Patron Cosmetic**:
```kotlin
if (player.playerSettings.hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee) {
    shopManager.grantCosmetic(CosmeticId("patron_title_badge"))
}
```

## Testing Verification

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Desktop Testing**:
- [ ] Creator Coffee appears in product catalog
- [ ] Purchase flow succeeds with $2.99 simulated payment
- [ ] `hasPurchasedCreatorCoffee` flag set to true
- [ ] Second purchase attempt shows "already purchased" error
- [ ] Choice tag `creator_coffee_purchased` logged
- [ ] Restore purchases includes Creator Coffee

### Compilation Status

**Build Command**:
```bash
./gradlew :core:model:compileKotlinDesktop :core:state:compileKotlinDesktop --no-daemon
```

**Result**: ✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 11s**

**Warnings**: Only expect/actual Beta warnings (framework-level, not errors)

## Design Rationale

### Why $2.99?
- **Accessible Price Point**: Lower barrier than typical IAP ($4.99+)
- **Coffee Metaphor**: Aligns with "buy the dev a coffee" culture
- **Emotional Connection**: Framed as support, not transaction
- **One-Time**: Shows commitment without ongoing payments

### Why One-Time Purchase?
- **Respect Player Intent**: Donation is meaningful gesture, not recurring revenue
- **Simple UX**: "Already supported" badge is clearer than "Buy again"
- **Fair Value**: $2.99 unlocks permanent rewards (shiny, dialogue, cosmetic)
- **Platform Compliance**: Follows App Store/Play Store non-consumable guidelines

### Why No Glimmer?
- **Pure Donation**: Separates support from in-game economy
- **Emotional Reward**: Focuses on gratitude/recognition over currency
- **Narrative Fit**: Exhausted Coder rewards feel personal, not transactional
- **Prevents Exploits**: Can't be min-maxed for "best value" farming
